			<p class="bold">I have had the pleasure to work with Joanna and Mission Bay on a number of search assignments for senior roles for Egmont. These have been for very different functional roles, but the diversity of the discipline has never been an issue. On all occasions Joanna has steered the process professionally, and from my point of view, effortlessly. And the results, excellent!</p>
