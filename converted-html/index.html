	<p class="tagline">Serving the Executive talent and Board needs of the TMT community globally.</p>	 
	<p>Our Mission is to be our clientsâ€™ trusted adviser and the best possible partner in terms of solving senior level recruitment and wider executive talent needs.
	<p>Mission Bay Ltd was founded to serve the Board and Executive talent needs of the TMT community in an innovative, consultative and bespoke manner.
	<p>We work locally, regionally and globally with clients drawn from all aspects of the TMT sector.
	<p>We work across all types of senior level roles within this community, frequently helping to define and fulfil newly constituted roles arising from fast-changing business needs.
	<p>We provide a bespoke service; we are proud that over 50% of our work comes from repeat clients, and the rest inevitably from referrals based on the experience of our clients and candidates in working with us. 
	<p>Being a boutique, we also happily and regularly work with a range of other search partners around the world, to ensure the best possible team is put in place of each search.
